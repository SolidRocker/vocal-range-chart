## Introduction

This is a web app that displays the vocal range some legendary vocalists picked from a list. You can also sort them according to their names, range, highest notes and lowest notes as well. This project is influenced by https://www.concerthotels.com/worlds-greatest-vocal-ranges, to build my own version of it.

The main goals of this project was
* Explore a new way of structuring files in React, and compare that to the current practices
* More in depth manipulation of ChartJS and dropdown lists

## Features

* Add a vocalist to the chart from a list
* Remove te vocalists by clicking on their bars
* Sorting added vocalist via name, highest note, lowest note and widest range
* A nice scrolling marquee of some of these vocalists
